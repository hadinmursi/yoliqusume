The man was at the height of his career during this time, and he was landing some of the biggest paychecks in all of Hollywood for his hilarious performances.</p><p>Tucker got his start as a youngster in comedy, and when finally given his chance to shine on screen, he was able to show what a valuable commodity he could be.</p><p>So, just how much money was Tucker pulling down at his peak?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After the massive success of the first "Rush Hour" movie, in 1999 Tucker negotiated $20 million to appear in the sequel. That's the same as earning $40 million for a single movie in today's dollars," Celebrity Net Worth reports.</p><p>The site also states that, "Chris earned at least $50 million from his work in the Rush Hour franchise alone, roughly $65 million after adjusting for inflation."</p><p>Tucker was a big deal, though his time on the big screen started to fade.</p><p>At the height of his career, Chris Tucker was on top of the world financially, but unfortunately, the good times simply weren't meant to last forever.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Chris Tucker Went From Earning $40 Million To Having A Negative Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-tucker-39-s-net-worth-fluctuated-over-time>Chris Tucker's Net Worth Fluctuated Over Time</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the unaware, Chris Tucker's financials took a hit, as he steadily disappeared from Hollywood and stopped collecting huge paydays.</p><p>"Unfortunately Chris has experienced some financial speed bumps over the years. After a series of financial mistakes, in 2011 Tucker found himself drowning in IRS debt. IRS and California tax filings would later reveal that Chris owed the IRS $11 million in taxes for the years 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005. By 2014 the debt had risen to $14 million.</p><p>Tucker's tax debt was finally settled in 2014," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> writes.</p><p>While tracking down exact figures is difficult, it's quite apparent that Tucker's net worth isn't what it used to be when he was one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors.</p><p>Despite the change in net worth, Tucker is still the proud owner of many fine things.

To start off, this home has everything anyone could possibly want. There is an old tennis court in the back of the property that looks quite splendid. Furthermore, the circular driveway it wonderfully grand. Also, the entrance has a covered drop off area that is perfectly landscaped. The overall feeling of the home is large, safe and luxurious. The red brick work is very Georgia style.
