marital union spanning more than two decades in an industry renowned for its rocky relationships is worthy of acclaim.&nbsp;It’s just a far cry from the pattern that’s been seen in Hollywood with celebrity marriages and relationships where separation and divorce are more like a default setting in such unions.</span></p><p><span>This is not to say that marriage is problem free or has had its storm free sail, but it is more like a survivor amidst all the inconveniences and many challenges that such a union battles.&nbsp;Nancy Carell and Steve Carell have been married since 1995 and have remained one of show business’s strongest couples.&nbsp;Let’s take a look at their cute love story.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-they-meet></span><strong><span>How did they meet?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>The beautiful love story presented in the troupe,&nbsp;</span><span>The second city</span><span>&nbsp;where Nancy was a student in a class taught by Steve.&nbsp;However, contrary to what you might think, the two comedic forces didn’t get along at first, despite being attracted to each other.&nbsp;Steve revealed that asking her out was kind of a herculean task as he kept beating around the bush for a long time.</span></p><p><span>He first thought that the lady he was interested in (Nancy) hated him because she acted calm around him even though he knew at first sight that she was his.&nbsp;But the truth was that she was just as nervous as he was and was just trying to act cool.</span></p><p><span>Still, the thought of possibly being rejected brought to mind his memory of the first girl he called out on a date in eighth grade.&nbsp;He received a NO for an answer, and from that time until Nancy’s acceptance, was cautious in his journey.</span></p><p><span>He didn’t start off on a fancy note but said something like if he had to ask someone out, it would be someone like her.&nbsp;Stupid right?&nbsp;But guess what?&nbsp;Nancy was right to give him a more awkward answer.&nbsp;She replied that if someone like Steve asked her out, she would definitely go out with him.&nbsp;If ever such a person existed and was certain, Steve was there of course.&nbsp;They were already in love with each other but didn’t know how to present their case.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this was only the beginning of their happily ever after.&nbsp;They then won a date and had their first date at the Green Mill jazz club.&nbsp;The tandem bonded on August 5, 1995. The journey was characterized by endless happiness.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-life-children></span><strong><span>Family life, children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>The couple share the same sense of humor, although Steve doesn’t think his wife is an easy laugh.&nbsp;He counted that as one of the many reasons he loves her.&nbsp;He considers Nancy the best indicator of the quality of jokes and says she challenges him intellectually and comically.&nbsp;Comically because she’s not someone who’s going to laugh at everything everyone does.</span></p><p><span>He then added that Nancy Carell, his wife is the smartest and funniest person he has ever met.&nbsp;And that he had never assumed that such a smart and attractive woman would be remotely interested in him.</span></p><p><span>She played her husband’s love several times.&nbsp;For example, in&nbsp;</span><span>The Office</span><span>&nbsp;where she portrayed a friend of hers and appeared with him on a number of shows, including&nbsp;</span><span>The Daily Show</span></p><p><span>Nancy Carell said of her husband that he was very funny and didn’t try so hard.&nbsp;They have two children, daughter Elisabeth (born May 25, 2001) and son John “Johnny” (born June 2004).</span></p><p><span>Predictably, their children seem to have inherited their parents’ sense of humor, described by their parents as very pure and honest in an interview.</span></p><p><span>The super-cute couple own a home in Los Angeles, as well as Marshfield, Massachusetts, where they have the option of escaping celebrity life during the summer.&nbsp;The duo also own The Marshfield Hills general store which they bought in 2009.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ynmKebqWKwor7EpaNmq6Saw6Z5wpqpnqScqHq4tcWeZJ%2Bhnpl6sMHTZquhnZmneqTB055kpaemmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-quentin-tarantinos-mom-and-what-does-she-do.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Quentin Tarantino's Mom, And What Does She Do?</a>
