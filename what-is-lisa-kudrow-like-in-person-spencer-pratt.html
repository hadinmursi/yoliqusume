Pratt tweeted that Lauren Conrad, who had previously fallen out with Spencer and his wife, should be "Kylie Jenner rich," which <a href=#>some people interpreted as a dig of some sort on Conrad</a>.</p><p>Whatever his intentions, that situation was less cut-and-dried than the derogatory mention he made of Lisa Kudrow.
