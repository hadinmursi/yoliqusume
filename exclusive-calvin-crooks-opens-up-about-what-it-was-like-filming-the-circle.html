Number two, I was excited to see what everyone else was looking like!"</strong></p><p>Calvin is quick to point out that, while the audience is only able to see him talking to a screen, he's seeing the show from an entirely different perspective - and that's an interesting aspect of the process for him.</p><h2 id=the-experience-of-speaking-to-a-screen>The Experience Of Speaking To A Screen</h2><p>Speaking of speaking to a screen, the personal chef (and trainee firefighter, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenrant</a> and <a href=#>Blurred Reality</a>!) explains that it was something of a new (albeit nostalgic) experience for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"The only time I would normally talk to a TV screen was when I was a kid playing Call of Duty - and I just used to yell at it!"</strong> he jokes.</p><p>Well, while that would surely keep viewers entertained, it's safe to say production was relieved Calvin wasn't yelling this time around!</p><h2 id=the-mental-health-aspect-of-39-the-circle-39>The Mental Health Aspect Of 'The Circle'</h2><p>Reflecting on what it was like, speaking to a screen, Calvin muses that while it felt<strong> "weird" </strong>at times, he was grateful that he was able to connect with someone throughout the filming process.</p><p><strong>"It gets lonely in there," </strong>he admits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'The Circle': Chloe Veitch Unveils Shocking Footage Of Pre-Filming Isolation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"The good thing with The Circle," </strong>Calvin contines,<strong> "is there's always someone on the other end to talk to you, to make sure that, mentally, you're okay, and everything is going to plan."</strong></p><p><strong>"Netflix have done a good job with after care, as well as while everything was still going on with the show," </strong>he nods.</p><h2 id=calvin-shares-what-surprised-him-the-most>Calvin Shares What Surprised Him The Most</h2><p>Whether or not Netflix was on hand to guide contestants through the experience, there were still some surprises, that even while small, threw him initially.</p><p><strong>"The alert sounds!" </strong>he gasps - or, shall we say, the lack thereof.</p><p><strong>"You don't hear the sounds when you get a message,"</strong> Calvin explains, adding, <strong>"you just look up at the screen."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he's quick to note that he adapted soon after realizing there would be notifications - <strong>"that's due to editing. They don't want to pick up the sound, so I get it," -</strong> it was an initial hurdle.</p><h2 id=calvin-weighs-in-on-the-introduction-of-new-rules>Calvin Weighs In On The Introduction Of New Rules</h2><p>Prior to being cast on The Circle, Calvin was an avid viewer of the <a href=#>UK version of the show</a>, so it only makes sense that new rules had the potential to mess with his game plan.</p><p>However, he's adamant that he took them in stride.</p><p>Asked whether he thought the new addition of being able to clone Circlers was something he deemed fair, Calvin answers,<strong> "with regards to anything that happens on any show, whether it's fair or not, we signed up for it."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Do Contestants On 'The Circle' Earn?</a></span></p><p>He adds that rule changes and additions are all about perspective, elaborating, <strong>"just to get into the show is a blessing in itself!"</strong></p><p>For that reason, he concludes that approach, from the start, was to take it all as it comes.</p><p>The question is, will that strategy work in his favor? Viewers will just have to stay tuned to see!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Exclusive: Chloe Veitch Reveals Who She Didn't Get Along With On 'The Circle' & 'THTH'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmmpqkpp67bq%2FRqKakq12kvaa60masqWWRl7y2wIywn5qsXZ7BbsPArGSloZuaeqe1y6agp59dqbWmecKiqZyklWJ8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fabio-is-back-with-i-cant-believe-its-not-butter-watch-the-commercial-w166892.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fabio Is Back With 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter': Watch the Commercial</a>
