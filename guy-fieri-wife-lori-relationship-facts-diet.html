According to Delish.com, he enjoys vegetables and salads.</p><p>It sounds like Guy Fieri is super close with his family and he and his wife, Lori, are total foodies who enjoy cooking and eating together. Guy and Lori have two sons, 25-year-old Hunter and 15-year-old Ryder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Guy talked about his marriage with Today.com and shared that his wife loves when he makes a pasta dish.

Since he was in charge of three restaurants and they were expecting their second baby, he didn't think that it was a good time, but Lori said he had to give it a shot.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Questioning If Chef Ramsay Really Took A Dig At Guy Fieri</a></span></p><h2 id=guy-and-lori>Guy And Lori</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Delish.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guy Fieri talked about his family</a> and said that they mean so much to him.
