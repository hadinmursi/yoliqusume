Jai Gillum said. “After going through years of tests, no one could tell us why we weren’t able to have children. It’s very unsettling. Not having an answer for this was just very confusing for me.”</p><p>That confusion grew into frustration and simmering pain. R. Jai Gillum was able to get pregnant but carrying a child to term proved to be more than her body could handle.</p><p>“We were able to get pregnant and experienced four miscarriages, three in one year,” she said. “That was a really tough experience.

Their relationships didn’t last through something like this.” “Something like this really tests your faith,” Gillum said.</p><p>After years of trying on their own, the couple turned to In Vitro Fertilization.&nbsp;“We ended up using a doctor in Jacksonville, so that was a lot,” R.

Luckily for us, our first try at IVF was successful.”</p><p>Andrew Demese Gillum and R. Jai had twins, Caroline and Jackson after four long years of trying. And while things finally worked out in their favor-often she worries about other couples tackling additional barriers to parenthood.</p><p>“Most can’t even afford the test to get to that much less being able to go through with a treatment like that,” She said. “I have decided that in my journey, especially now that we have been blessed with our family, that I want to be helpful to people that are going through that same thing.”</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About R.Jai Gillum</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-rjai-gillum></span><span>Who is R.Jai Gillum?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>R.
