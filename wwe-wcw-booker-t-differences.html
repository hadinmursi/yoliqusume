There was the singles success, but Booker spent more time in the tremendous tag team with Stevie Ray. WCW booked the real-life brothers to continue their tag team together as Harlem Heat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The record-setting <a href=#>ten WCW Tag Team Championship reigns for Harlem Heat</a> will always be at the top of the history books. Booker’s potential in a singles role ended the tag run, but he could have easily continued that tag run with the drawing power involved for the division.</p><h2 id=longer-hair-in-wwe><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Longer Hair In WWE</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Booker-T-United-States-Champion.jpg><p>The biggest physical change for Booker T between his WCW and WWE stints featured his hair. Booker typically had a short cut for most of his WCW run before growing it out a little towards the end, but it was still a shorter look.</p><p>The WWE run would see Booker slowly growing it out without cutting it back to the shorter look for his WCW days. Booker’s hair eventually grew to longer dreads for the final few years and became synonymous with him to fans who didn’t watch WCW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=more-memorable-rivalries-in-wcw><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>More Memorable Rivalries In WCW</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Booker-T-Vs-Scott-Steiner.jpg><p>The WCW run of <a href=#>Booker T featured him having stronger rivalries</a> with wrestlers than WWE. Scott Steiner was viewed as the biggest rival to Booker T due to their singles program as the last big feud in the company. The Harlem Heat vs Steiner Brothers tag feud added to their feud before the bigger run.</p><p>Chris Benoit and Booker had one of the best rivalries in WCW history that culminated with a memorable best of seven series. WWE did see Booker have a legendary run, but few rivalries stood out. John Cena, Batista and Edge were some of Booker’s big feuds lacking compared to the intensity of his WCW time.</p><h2 id=became-a-locker-room-leader-in-wwe><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Became A Locker Room Leader In WWE</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Booker-T-The-Undertaker.jpg><p>The biggest change for Booker T between the two promotions was his standing backstage. Booker was considered a younger star for WCW since the veterans were the ones holding down the top main event spots.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Backstage Stories About Booker T That We Can't Believe</a></span></p><p>The WWE tenure played out with Booker eventually becoming one of the veterans of the locker room.

Booker adopted a new name and persona that was used in his independent wrestling days before WCW.</p><p>G.I.

WWE did witness Booker becoming the most successful name from the Invasion. However, he was never “the” top star in WCW.
