Sometimes he overthrew his receivers due to his arm strength, while other times, he underthrew them.</p><p>He also tossed some wobbly passes, possibly due to a mechanical quirk where he flips the ball in his hand before throwing it.</p><p>If he can clean things up with solid quarterback coaching, he could emerge as a quality NFL starter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-levis-net-worth></span>Will Levis: Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Based on the online information, Will Levis is a successful and affluent individual with a net worth of approximately $1 million U.S. as of 2022.</p><p>Levis graduated from Penn State’s Smeal College of Business with a bachelor’s degree in finance in May 2021 before transferring to the University of Kentucky later that year.</p><p>In his first start as Kentucky’s starting quarterback, he threw for 367 yards and four touchdowns, demonstrating his unique skill set.</p><p>Levis continued to lead Kentucky throughout the season, completing 233 of 353 passes for 2,827 yards and 24 touchdown passes while rushing for 376 yards and nine touchdowns on 107 carries.</p><p>He was instrumental in securing a victory over No. 15 Iowa in the 2022 Citrus Bowl.</p><p>Levis’s impressive performance on the football field, combined with his degree in finance, likely contributed to his financial success and net worth.</p><p>With his hard work and determination, Levis’s net worth may continue to grow.</p><p><span>Also Read: </span>NBA: John Konchar Wife – Is He Married With His Girlfriend?
