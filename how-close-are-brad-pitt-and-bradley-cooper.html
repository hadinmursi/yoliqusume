Earlier that night Pitt also watched Cooper perform in The Elephant Man at the Haymarket Theatre in London.</p><p>Since then, they’ve been spotted out together several more times. For instance, in 2017, Pitt and Cooper attended the Glastonbury Festival together. While there, Pitt also met up with actress Tilda Swinton for a screening of her film, Okja. Meanwhile, Cooper took to the stage to film a scene for his film A Star is Born.</p><p>At some point, the two Brads also hung out with musician Chris Simmons. He later made a post on Instagram with the caption, “When you get your photo with Brad Pitt photobombed by Bradley Cooper!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Anyone Even Remember Brad Pitt's First Movie Role?</a></span></p><p>Years later, in 2019, Pitt and Cooper got everyone buzzing when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they decided to watch the men’s singles final of the U.S. Open together</a>.

Cooper, for his part, realized he had addiction issues when he was 29, thanks to his other good friend, fellow actor Will Arnett.</p><p>Cooper came to the realization that he had some serious problems after he spoke with Arnett following a dinner party with the comedian’s then-wife Amy Poehler.</p><p>“Will was like, 'Hey man, do you remember we had dinner the other night? How do you think that went?' I remember being at the dinner thinking I was so funny, and I thought these two guys who were my heroes thought that I was so funny. I was like 'I thought it was great. I thought I was killing,’” Cooper recalled while speaking on Arnett’s SmartLess podcast with Sean Hayes and Jason Bateman.</p><p>Turns out, that’s not exactly things went down. “Will Arnett was like, 'You were a real (expletive), man. You were a real (expletive).'” That was the moment when Cooper knew that something had to change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That was the first time I ever realized I had a problem with drugs and alcohol,” he continued. “The guy that I think is doing mean humor is telling me the truth and it changed my entire life.”</p><p>Meanwhile, years later, Cooper got the opportunity to pay it forward when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitt revealed that he was dealing with alcohol addiction</a>. “I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something. Something. And you realize that a lot of it is, um—cigarettes, you know, pacifiers,” the Oscar winner once admitted.</p><p>“And I'm running from feelings. I'm really, really happy to be done with all of that. I mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know—things I wasn't dealing with. I was boozing too much. It's just become a problem.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Is Brad Pitt Putting Plan B Entertainment Up For Sale Despite Numerous Awards?</a></span></p><p>Since then, Pitt said that he managed to turn his life around thanks to Cooper. When Pitt stood onstage at the National Board of Review Awards to receive his Best Supporting Actor award from Cooper, the Oscar winner remarked, “Bradley just put his daughter to bed and rushed over here to do this. He’s a sweetheart. I got sober because of this guy, and every day has been happier ever since.”</p><p>As it turns out, Pitt ended up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for a year and a half</a>. “I had a really cool men’s group here that was really private and selective, so it was safe,” the actor said. “Because I’d seen things of other people who had been recorded while they were spilling their guts, and that’s just atrocious to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Pitt and Cooper are both in a better place and likely hanging out together.
