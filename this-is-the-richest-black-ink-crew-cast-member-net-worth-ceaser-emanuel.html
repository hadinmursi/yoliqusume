The success of Black Ink Crew has brought about the advent of a spin-off series, titled Black Ink Crew: Chicago, which so far consists of seven seasons and 100 episodes.</p><p>The original show is set in Harlem, New York City and has seen dozens of cast members in its 174-episode history so far.

He missed out on Season 5 of the show, after having been a core part of the main cast for the first four seasons. He returned in Season 6 as a guest star, and later in a supporting role in Season 7.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robinson was fully reinstated to main cast status in the two most recent seasons of the show.

He played a more supporting role in Seasons 6 and 7, before being demoted even further into a guest role in the two most recent seasons of the show.</p><p>His name is normally censored as “Richard” Duncan on the series. Originally hailing from South Carolina, the 37-year-old’s net worth is rumored to stand at around the $350,000 mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sky-days---500-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sky Days - $500,000</span></h2><p>Sky Days started out her time on Black Ink Crew as a guest cast member in the first season of the show, back in 2013. From the second season onwards, though, she was promoted to a regular, replacing Alex Estevez who was fired from the show.</p><p>According to multiple outlets online, Days is said to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth around $500,000</a> today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Stars Of ‘Black Ink Crew’: Who Is Still On The Show And Who Has Left The Tattoo Shop Behind?</a></span></p><h2 id=dutchess-lattimore---800-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dutchess Lattimore - $800,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dutchess Lattimore has not been on Black Ink Crew in the last four seasons, but she was a starring cast member in the first five seasons of the show. Unfortunately she had to deal with incidents of racism and a spell of depression following her exit, but she did manage to bounce back.</p><p>Lattimore is now the proud owner of a tattoo shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is also a radio host. She is estimated to have a net worth of about $800,000.</p><h2 id=donna-lombardi---1-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Donna Lombardi - $1 Million</span></h2><p>Donna Lombardi joined Black Ink Crew in Season 3, originally as a supporting cast member.

He was famously in an on-and-off relationship with Dutchess Lattimore, until they permanently called it quits.</p><p>Unfortunately for Emanuel, his spell on the show appears to have come to an end, if indeed there will be a Season 10. After a video of him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hitting his dog</a> went viral, he was fired by VH1.

It is no wonder, then, that he stands head and shoulders above all his Black Ink Crew cast members as the richest, with a net worth of around $4 million.</p><p>Ruks was a supporting cast member on the show in the first three seasons, but has been starring in each of those that followed after that.
