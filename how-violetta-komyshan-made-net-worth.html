Shortly after the purchase of their new NYC apartment, news came out that the couple split in November 2022. Their breakup was confirmed by Komyshan only after Elgort was seen being intimate with a mystery woman while on vacation in Italy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite how upsetting their split may have been for some fans, the fact is that Violetta Komyshan is still the part-owner of a $760,000 apartment.

When asked during an interview with E! News about how she's enjoying her single life, she replied, "I think it's fun." She also advised young women to, "Focus on your work and your passion. I'm 26, so right now is the age to push ahead and focus on that - on yourself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-63.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, the news of the allegations brought against Ansel Elgort would've awoken suspicions in the mind of Violetta Komyshan. According to The Cut, in June 2020, a Twitter user who claimed to be a fan of Elgort accused him of assaulting her in 2014. She said that after meeting on Snapchat, Elgort (who was 20 at the time) and the anonymous accuser (who was 17) exchanged messages which led to a personal encounter, where Elgort coerced her intimacy. Elgort has denied the allegations, but the damage seems to have already been done to their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dq7awuMStq5plm6S6ur%2FHmqVmpZGZsm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-much-money-does-patti-jackson-make-latest-patti-jackson-net-worth-income-salary.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Much Money Does Patti Jackson Make?
