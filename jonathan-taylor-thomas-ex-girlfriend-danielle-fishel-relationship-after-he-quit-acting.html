According to Cinemablend.com, the actress said in one episode of Pod Meets World that she and Jonathan Taylor Thomas had a relationship back in the '90s. She said, "Jonathan was my first boyfriend, when I was like 12."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jonathan Taylor Thomas And Scarlett Pomers Aren't The Only Child Stars To Keep Their Lives A Secret After Vanishing From Hollywood</a></span></p><p>It sounds like the actors were together in the early or mid-90s. It must have been an exciting time in both of their lives since they were starring on hit shows that had similar fanbases. Season 1 of Boy Meets World aired in 1993 and started two years earlier in 1991. Both shows aired on ABC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2023, when Fishel was interviewed by Elle, she was asked about her "first celebrity crush." She mentioned her famous ex-boyfriend and shared that the Home Improvement and Boy Meets World sets were close together. It's possible that this is how they met and began dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/home-improvement-tim-allen-jonathan-taylor-thomas-patricia-richardson.jpg><p>Fishel told Elle, "I would’ve said Jonathan Taylor Thomas, because he was a celebrity at the time, but he was my first real-life Danielle crush. I worked next door to him on Home Improvement. But I knew him, so that’s a little different.

She speaks highly of the show's other actors as well.</p><p>While Fishel and Jonathan Taylor Thomas haven't explicitly said that they are good friends these days, it doesn't appear that they ever lost contact with one another.</p><p>It seems likely that they broke up because they dated as young teenagers who also starred on hit shows. It must have been tough to find time to go on dates. It's also possible that they weren't all that serious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonathan-taylor-thomas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Fishel is open about her past relationships, Thomas seems to be much more close-lipped.

According to People, Jonathan Taylor Thomas was at the wedding. This could mean that Fishel and Thomas stayed close with each other even after breaking up. They were still in contact several decades after breaking up, which must mean something positive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/do-jonathan-taylor-thomas-and-ex-girlfriend-danielle-fishel-still-have-a-relationship-after-he-quit-acting_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe the actress invited Thomas to her wedding because they have been friends since the '90s and have been hanging out regularly ever since. On the other hand, though, she might have been feeling nostalgic and remembering all the good times that they shared. Maybe she included him because he meant a lot to her at one point in her life and she wanted him there for this special event.</p><p>Fishel said some really sweet things about her wedding day and described tearing up right before the ceremony. However, she and Belusko shared that they were divorcing in 2015, and she married her second and current husband Jensen Karp in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/danielle-fishel.jpg><p>While Fishel and Karp's wedding included actor, comedian and podcast host Lauren Lapkus and Boy Meets World actor Will Friedle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Danielle Fishel Wanted Boy Meets World To End, But Later Regretted It</a></span></p><p>It sounds like Danielle Fishel puts effort into her friendships and makes sure that when people are in her life, she sees them as much as she can. In a 2023 interview with E! News, she answered a question about the Boy Meets World actors hanging out.</p><p>Fishel said that she and Rider Strong made sure to get everyone together regularly. She said, <strong>"</strong>Rider and I are both pretty good about that. Probably more so me—but we all stay in touch and make sure we think ahead, like, 'We're all going to be in the same place.

When asked about the impact that playing Topanga Lawrence had on her, she said, "Anything that you do for that long during those influential years of your life I think sticks with you forever. I was on that show from 12 to 19. The people I worked with were like a second family to me. That show was such a good experience and really shaped my idea of what working as an actor is supposed to be like. I’m really glad it did, because I take that with me on every job I go into."</p><p>Since Danielle Fish has such fuzzy and warm feelings about her years filming Boy Meets World, it's likely that she feels the same way about Jonathan Taylor Thomas. But since he hasn't acted or spoken publicly for several years, it doesn't seem that he is going to comment on their relationship, past or present.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoytmLKkn6d6tbTOppisZZWteqi10aWdq6GVo7FusMCnoJ6knJp6p7XSoZylZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqistOeqWaglWK%2BtrXTZpicrJmjtHA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eddie-redmayne-and-hannah-bagshawes-relationship-timeline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Eddie Redmayne and Hannah Bagshawe's Relationship Timeline</a>
