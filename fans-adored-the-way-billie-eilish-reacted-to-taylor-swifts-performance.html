During that evening, Swift took home the Artist of the Decade Award, and she performed a brilliant medley of songs for her global audience.</p><p>"I guess what I’m trying to say is that all anyone in this room wants is to create something that will last, whatever it is in life, and the fact that this is an award that celebrates a decade of hard work and of art and of fun and memories—all that matters to me is the memories that I’ve had with you the fans over the years. you guys we’ve had fun, incredible, exhilarating times together, and may it continue," Swift said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchfork</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Eilish being caught enjoying the show also serves as a reminder that she was a Swift fan growing up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Didn't Recognize Orlando Bloom Meeting Him For The First Time, But Had The Best Reaction Afterwards</a></span></p><h2 id=billie-eilish-was-a-fan-of-taylor-swift-growing-up>Billie Eilish Was A Fan Of Taylor Swift Growing Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/billie-eilish-wearing-a-gucci-outfit.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When speaking with iHeart</a>, Billie touched on many topics, eventually revealing that her favorite song growing up was by none other than Taylor Swift.</p><p>"I used to love this song when I was, like, four — no, probably older than that. Probably, like, six. It's crazy. It's very country. When I listen to it now, I'm like, 'Wow, I totally didn't realize how country this was.' But I loved this song back then because I thought it was so bada--. I thought it was so cool and mean. I just loved it," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then added that she had no idea that it was a Taylor Swift song until she was an adult.</p><p>"I actually didn't know it was Taylor Swift until this year. I didn't understand at all what a 'picture to burn' meant. The only word 'burn' that I knew, that I thought that she meant, was, like, when you burn a CD," she said.</p><p>Turns out, the feelings of admiration flow both ways.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Wasn't Supposed To Appear On This Late Night Talk Show, But Her Last Minute Appearance Had Everyone In Tears</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-given-praise-to-billie-eilish-in-the-past>Taylor Swift Has Given Praise To Billie Eilish In The Past</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-wearing-black-onstage.jpg><p>Previously, Taylor Swift has given flowers to many women in the music business, including Billie Eilish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, 'But he's always been nice to me,' when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their rights to own their music. And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs," Swift said.</p><p>"The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media posts, that he could 'buy me,'" Swift said. "But I'm obviously not going willingly," she said.</p><p>She went on to add, "Yet the most amazing thing to discover was that it would be the women in this industry who would have my back, and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times. And I will never, ever forget it.
