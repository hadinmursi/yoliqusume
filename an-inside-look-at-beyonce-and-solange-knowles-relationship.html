It is not uncommon for people to do so, just as they have with the likes of Owen and Luke Wilson, Bella and Gigi Hadid, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley and Noah Cyrus</a>. It is no easy feat living in your more famous sibling's shadow and being measured to their success.</p><p>The two sisters are extremely supportive of one another and have a really close bond.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé And Solange Knowles Look Almost Identical In These 13 Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=they-are-supportive-of-one-another>They Are Supportive Of One Another</h2><p>Beyoncé and Solange Knowles are some of, if not the most famous siblings in the world. Despite both of them being award-winning singers, there's no doubt that Beyoncé is the bigger star. This has left many people&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wondering whether it's hard for Solange to live in her elder sister's shadow.</a>&nbsp;However, it doesn't appear that way, as Solange is a respected artist who's comfortable in her own skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Solange is a star in her own right and has made waves in the music industry. Perhaps what stands out most about her music is that it's totally different from that of her sister Beyoncé's. People often draw comparisons between the sisters which is a disservice to both. Sure there are similarities between them, but their individuality always shines through.</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any sibling rivalry between the two, they are both hardworking women who respect each other's craft. It has also become evident over the years that the Knowles sisters are extremely supportive and protective of one another. Solange has always looked up to her sister and Beyoncé has undoubtedly had an impact on her sister's career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Solange Knowles: Here Are Little Known Facts About Beyonce's Younger Sister</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-she-jealous-of-beyonc-s-relationship-with-kelly-rowland>Was She Jealous Of Beyoncé's Relationship With Kelly Rowland?</h2><p>Beyoncé rose to fame at an early age with one of the biggest girl bands in the world - Destiny's Child. She went on to attain unimaginable success as a solo artist after the group was disbanded. She formed a close friendship with former bandmate Kelly Rowland, and the two are still seemingly as close as they were back then. Solange being five years younger than Beyoncé was just a child when her sister rose to stardom and that could not have been easy.</p><p>Of course, it would have been absolutely natural for her to feel left out. She reportedly turned to songwriting for solace. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Zealand Herald</a>, the singer revealed "My sister and Kelly [Rowland] were the same age, which is like a built-in best friend in the house; they were extremely close."</p><p>"Writing felt like this insular thing that I could go back in my room and express all that I would observe, all the emotions that would arise.

According to their mother, Ms. Tina Lawson, as children, Beyoncé was irritated by Solange wanting to hang out with her and her friends. Sibling rivalries are common, but it could potentially have gotten out of hand if left unchecked.</p><p>Their mother took them to therapy early on to ensure that Beyoncé was more sensitive to Solange's feelings. It was also to help the latter deal with any feelings of jealousy-that could have developed from living in her sister's shadow. She also ensured that she devoted individual time to her daughters.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, Ms. Tina revealed, "I took them to counseling very early. So that the counselor could help Beyoncé be more sensitive to Solange because she couldn’t stand her for a minute. You know, when they were little, when she was five, she was all in her stuff, she was trying to hang around her and her friends. Beyoncé was really irritated. But it made her more sensitive to who her sister was and what she had to deal with because of her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looks like Ms. Tina raised some mighty fine women with a strong work ethic and an understanding of the importance of sisterhood.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Richest Celebrity Siblings, According To Their Combined Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnBnrCoppOaeqK6w2aqqKSRo7SmecqnprCklah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bella-poarch-famous-tiktok-how-old-is-bella-poarch-instagram-followers.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bella Poarch Famous Tiktok: How Old Is Bella Poarch?
