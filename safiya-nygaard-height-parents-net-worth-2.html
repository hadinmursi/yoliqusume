Her videos regularly top at least one million views, thanks to her lively character as well as her willingness to experiment with outrageous outfits and different beauty products.</p><p>Here are the things to know about Safiya Nygaard including her age, ethnicity, net worth, and much more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=safiya-nygaards-background-age-and-ethnicity></span><strong>Safiya Nygaard’s Background, Age and Ethnicity</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safiya Nygaard was born on the 16th of July 1992. She grew up in Illinois, Chicago which is also her birthplace. Not much is known about her family except the fact that her mother is Indian&nbsp;while her father is Danish. Though Safiya is American by nationality, she is of mixed ethnic origin – Indian and Danish.</p><p>Safiya studied at the Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in the Greater Chicago Area before proceeding to Stanford University for her tertiary education from 2010 to 2014. She majored in English and Drama at Stanford.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=journey-to-youtube-stardom></span><strong>Journey To YouTube Stardom</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Safiya’s journey into creating and producing video content started in the university where she oversaw many theatrical productions. On graduating, she interned for some companies before joining BuzzFeed in November 2015. At BuzzFeed, she was part of the duo that created the highly successful BuzzFeed video series Ladylike.&nbsp;The series follows women’s fashion and beauty and often shows ladies trying out various fashion and makeup experiments. Ladylike was instrumental in increasing the number of subscribers to BuzzFeed’s yellow channel, where the series was shown.</p><p>Safiya left BuzzFeed in early 2017 and in March, she gave her reasons for doing so in a YouTube video. According to her, the executives at BuzzFeed limited her freedom to interact with followers of the show; she and her co-creator were also left out of crucial decision making with regard to matters such as branding. Safiya also felt that she was being exploited by the company which wanted to sell merchandise using her name.</p><p>This video marked the start of Safiya’s own YouTube channel Safiya Nygaard. The channel x-rays women’s fashion, beauty treatments, and makeup. The videos usually involve&nbsp;Safiya trying out various outfits and makeup and posting her experience. She has allowed strangers to pick her makeup and has tried out an 18-hour lipstick to see if it really lived up to its promise.</p><p>In one of her videos, Safiya melted every single lipstick carried by Sephora Cosmetics. The experiment consisted of 603 tubes of lipstick from 20 different brands. The result was a raspberry shade which she gifted to some of her lucky followers. The video is one of her most viewed videos with up to 18 million views.</p><p>Safiya’s ability to interact with her subscribers is part of the reasons why she is so successful. Other reasons include the fact that her videos are well thought-out and well-planned and are not only entertaining but actually helpful. Safiya has up to 6 million subscribers. Her innovative videos earned her a nomination for Youtuber of the Year at the 2018 Shorty Awards.</p><p>Some keen observers&nbsp;have accused BuzzFeed of copying some of Safiya’s&nbsp;ideas. For instance, in May 2017, she tried out a liquid lipstick which claims that it can last for 18 hours. A few months later,&nbsp;an episode on Ladylike&nbsp;tried out a lipstick that claimed it can last 24 hours.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-parents></span><strong>Her Parents</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As earlier stated, Safiya’s mum whom she simply refers to as Mumtaz is Indian. She is from Pune, one of the largest cities in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Safiya’s dad, on the other hand, is Scandinavian, specifically Denmark. Safiya is proud of her multiracial heritage. She regularly displays pictures of her parents together on her social media pages. Also, she has talked about the struggles she faces as a multiracial person, not quite fitting in with either of the two groups that she comes from.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-safiyas-boyfriend></span><strong>Who Is Safiya’s Boyfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safiya is currently in a relationship with fellow YouTube star and Stanford alumni, Tyler William. The two reportedly met in L.A. in 2014 and started dating later that same year.</p><p>Tyler often doubles as Safiya’s Cameraman and regularly participates in her videos. On one episode, Tyler picked out Safiya’s outfit for the day, in another episode, he did her makeup. In yet another episode, they both swapped clothes for a whole week!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-rich-is-she></span><strong>How Rich Is She?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Safiya is reportedly worth about $3 million. This is not bad at all for a young lady who had the courage to leave a stable job to make her own way. Her earnings do not only come from her YouTube channel but also from Tiger Dad Comedy, where she creates, writes, produces, and directs funny online videos.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-facts-about-the-youtuber></span><strong>Height and Other Facts About The YouTuber</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>1. Safiya is not so tall, she stands at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78m). But what she ‘lacks’ in height, she more than makes up for with her lively personality.</p><p>2. Safiya is not only an avid fan of Harry Porter but also a fan of Game of Thrones.</p><p>3. The YouTuber and her boyfriend own a cat together named Crusty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuRm7a6rYynsKCZkaexbrTEop6hrF2lrrOxza2qZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2ZqXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./stephen-amell-marries-cassandra-jean-for-the-second-time-2013285.html>&#171;&nbsp;Stephen Amell Cassandra Jean Wedding Picture: Arrow Star Gets Married</a>
