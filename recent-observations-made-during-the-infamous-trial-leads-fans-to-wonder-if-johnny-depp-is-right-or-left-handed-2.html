Dextral Nature Observations Made in Trial<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Some recent observations that were made in the fifth week of the court hearing of Amber Heard-Johnny Depp’s defamation trial parted some shades to the dextral trend of actor Johnny Depp. There have been some serious questions regarding which hand Depp uses most in daily activities and while in reel life, featured in big movies.</p><p>There have been some inconsistencies regarding his hand use and preference as per reports.</p><p>Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who surmises himself in every role that he portrays thereby making the character an essence, not just an ephemeral session. He has previously served in big movie projects and his characters have been left-handed. While Johnny Depp is actually right-handed and uses his right hand in most of his daily activities, his roles in movies have not followed the same pattern.</p><p>In his early movie work with ‘Benny and Joon’ that was released in 1993, Johnny led his character while using his left hand in actions like writing. This was intentionally done to the part natural tendency of disoriented writing style to Johnny’s character in the movie, therefore paving the way to a more naive and neophyte writer, so as to say, a child’s writing.</p><p>Johnny also had to suffer a loss to his hand’s finger in the domestic violence case, h=the hearing of which has now climaxed to its very fifth week.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-on-johnny-depps-left-hand-observation-made-during-amber-heard-trial></span>Details On Johnny Depp’s Left Hand Observation Made During Amber Heard Trial<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnny Depp sued his former wife Amber Heard for $50 million after she shared a falsified report about domestic violence from Depp in 2018 penned by a Washington Post article. After Johnny sued her for defamation, AMber sued him back with a $100 million lawsuit stating that Johnny tried to prove her true words as a fake alibi.</p><p>Amber has been failing multiple times in her recent court hearing as her statement lack a predefined flow of events, inconsistencies with order and pattern, some absurd and created situations, and a few falsified reports again. Johnny’s lawyers have been iteratively attacking Heard with serious questions, and she has been dampened in many rebuttals as well.</p><p>The injury pattern and their emergence on the left side of the face have called into question the dextral nature of the two involved, while lawyers are still equally confused about the actual identity of the original abuser and the actual victim of the violence.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=johnny-depps-illness-report-does-he-have-any-medical-condition></span>Johnny Depp’s Illness Report-Does He Have Any Medical Condition?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not much has been divulged about Johnny Depp’s medical condition in accordance with the dextral observations made in the hearing.</p><p>Johnny has been seriously addicted to a few of drugs and the reports have also been presented to the court during the lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqVmLKvwIyomaydoquutbXOp6pmpZGZsm6w1Kugp59dqbWmecinnZqln6rAbsDRopilZZyarqW%2FjJ%2BYp6tdqbxuw86nm56qXZ6zbrbOoaWnsV2ZsrG8jKKqZqqZnLW1ec6rZKWdlql6qa3NnZydZWJk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./red-white-and-royal-blue.html>&#171;&nbsp;Red White And Royal Blue</a>
