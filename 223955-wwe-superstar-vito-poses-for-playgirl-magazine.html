id=more-223955></span><br>The following is from WWE.com:</p><p>The toughest man to ever wear a dress became the sexiest man to take off a dress, when Vito recently nod all for Playgirl magazine.</p><p>It was the SmackDown Superstarâs first time posing for a magazine other than WWE Magazine, and he admitted that being featured in Playgirl is a secret dream come true. Vito was overjoyed, pumped and ready to take it all off for the April 2007 issue, and WWE.com was with him for his big day.</p><p>âItâs very humbling, and itâs a very honorable thing to be asked to do a magazine like Playgirl. Youâve already seen WWE Divas go to Playboy,â Vito told WWE.com.</p><p>âItâs just an honor and a privilege to represent WWE and SmackDown. To be able to do a magazine like that â¢ I guess if youâre going to do it, you might as well go all the way,â Vito said.</p><p>Well, almost all the way. While Vito took it all off for the cameras, he was strategically placed so Playgirl readers wonât see everything â¢ some will have to be left up to the imagination.</p><p>âUnfortunately thereâs no full monty,â said Colleen Kane, senior editor for Playgirl. âThe WWE fans can expect to see as close to the full monty as possible without crossing that line.â</p><p>WWE fans will see Vito having fun in his French maidâs dress in the WWE ring; and posing in several sexy, animal print outfits and a Versace shirt. He also looked buff in a jock strap and leopard print robe, wet after stepping out of the locker room shower.</p><p>âTheyâre going to see the Vito who goes out there every day and has a lot of fun,â Vito said.<br>âI did this in a very prestigious, honorable way. I want everybody to enjoy it because you can be who you want to be â¢ you donât have to show off or show anything or be disgusting. Itâs done very tastefully, and Iâm representing myself and the WWE,â Vito recalled.</p><p>In a special scene, Vito dons a sexy, white, Marilyn Monroe-style dress and mink stole. He posed with wind effects, reminiscent of Monroeâs famous billowing dress scene from the 1955 film, The Seven Year Itch.</p><p>âThat was definitely one of the sexiest things Iâve ever done so far,â Vito smiled.</p><p>âFor a woman to be Marilyn Monroe and think that they can be that sexy, and have the dress blowing â¢ thatâs a shot thatâs lasted for like 50 years â¢ and I just got to relive it in the last 10 minutes, so I think it was a great thing. I think everybody should try it just once,â Vito continued.</p><p>While Vito said he keeps himself in tiptop shape for wrestling in the SmackDown ring, he went through some extra-special preparations for his Playgirl shoot.</p><p>âThe last few weeks Iâve done a lot of heavy, heavy dieting, low carbs, extra cardio, trying to cut up as much as possible. Iâm at the lowest weight Iâve ever been in my pro career â¢ 209. But the hard work I put into it was all worth it,â Vito said with pride.</p><p>âI also had a full body wash and facial the day before the shoot. I had a manicure and pedicure, and my eyebrows done. Just another week at the spa for Vito,â he revealed.</p><p>Greg Weiner, the shootâs photographer, said it was his first time shooting a man in a dress for Playgirl. While it was a unique situation, he said Vitoâs bubbly, outgoing and friendly personality made the shoot easy. Weiner rated Vito a perfect 10 as a Playgirl model.</p><p>âI think the readers of Playgirl will be surprised and entertained by it. Heâs not the classic model for Playgirl, so I think theyâll embrace that part of it,â Weiner told WWE.com. âHe has a different personality, and also he was willing to show a little skin. Thatâs the tough thing with celebrities â¢ they donât want to show anything. It was great that he was open and willing to do that for the readers. I think itâll go over pretty big, actually.â</p><p>Vito loved the special attention he received throughout the day as a Playgirl model, and he hoped it will help his personality shine through in the pictorial.</p><p>âThis is just another day at the office, but I have to tell you, Iâm having one of the greatest times of my life right now,â Vito admitted.</p><p>âAfter this is gone, and all you people go home, nobodyâs going to give me a robe and some shorts, or give me any clothes or grab me a water â¢ I have to do it on my own, so I mine as well be pampered for a day. Thatâs why Iâm enjoying it so much,â Vito laughed.</p><p>Kane said Playgirl gets many requests from readers hoping to see WWE Superstars in the magazine. Since Vito did such a magnificent job, Kane said she hopes this isnât the last time a WWE Superstar is featured.</p><p>âVito did very well. He seems like a natural. Heâs very comfortable in front of the camera, posing. Heâs striking some great poses,â Kane said. âI hope we could see more WWE Superstars in Playgirl. If it were up to us, Iâd think so. Itâs just a matter of what wrestler wants to try it next.â</p><p>After the completion of the shoot, a relaxed, content Vito candidly spoke to WWE.com about his overall experience.</p><p>âItâs probably the most exciting day Iâve ever had. I never thought I could look anything like the way they made me look. I definitely put a lot of hard work into it, and it just definitely showed today,â Vito recalled.</p><p>âI was able to really be myself, and it was just a tremendous feeling. I felt very alive. I felt very appealing. I felt very sexy out there,â he said with a smile.</p><p>âIt was definitely a great day for Vito, for WWE, SmackDown, all the WWE fans all around the world. I definitely represented. Iâm proud of myself because I was able to do this with a lot of hard work and dedication. Today was Vitoâs Playgirl day, when all my dreams came true.â</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpFscG5tXazEpnnSrqeeqqOprrN51aKrqGWgpMCmv4yfpqtloKGuurPIq6NmpZGcrru1zZ4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./married-first-sight-jessika-power-shares-tribute-boyfriend-connor-thompson.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Married At First Sight' Star Jessika Power Shares Adorable Tribute To Boyfriend Connor Thompson</a>
