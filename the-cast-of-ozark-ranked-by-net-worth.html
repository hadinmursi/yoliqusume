That's not to say that every character on Ozark is doomed. Although given the high-stakes, dark, and brutal world Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams have created, it certainly seems as though most of the characters will face the consequences of their actions. So many already have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be cast of Ozark is a gift. There's no doubt the numerous actors who have had their characters killed off in the first three seasons have benefited from the popularity of the show. This includes the likes of Jordana Spiro, Trevor Long, Tom Pelphrey, Jason Butler Harner, Janet McTeer, and Peter Mullan. All of whome have seen their net worths increase drastically. But what about the cast members on the show who live to see the beginning of season 4? Just how much money do they have going into the finale season?</p><h2 id=carson-holmes-is-worth-100-000><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Carson Holmes Is Worth $100,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carson Holmes, who plays Three on Ozark, is building a respectable net worth for himself, according to ArticleBio. This is especially true given the fact that his main source of income appears to come from Ozark. Although, he also played a small role in Amazon's Uncle Frank and in The Best of Enemies.</p><h2 id=skylar-gaertner-is-worth-300-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Skylar Gaertner Is Worth $300,000</span></h2><p>Skylar is best-known for playing Jonah on Ozark but his role of Young Matt Murdock on Netflix's Daredevil and his work in acclaimed Independent films such as I Smile Back has also gained him some notoriety. Still, he's at the beginning of his career. According to StarsGab, Skylar is worth a healthy $300,000. And there's no doubt that number is growing rapidly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-hublitz-is-worth-500-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sofia Hublitz Is Worth $500,000</span></h2><p>The young woman behind Charlotte Byrde is another star on the rise. While she's been cast in a couple of Louie CK projects, Sofia hasn't done much else other than Ozark. However, her supporting role on Ozark has earned her a cool half a million, according to The WikiFeed.</p><h2 id=kevin-l-johnson-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kevin L. Johnson Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Sam Dermody has been very lucky throughout the first three seasons of Ozark. Has this sealed his tragic fate in the upcoming fourth and final season? Perhaps. But in the meantime, the man who plays him has made quite a bit of money. Since 2009, Kevin L. Johnson has had small roles in numerous high-profile projects that have built his net worth and his reputation in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=felix-solis-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Felix Solis Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Felix Solis plays the big-bad in Ozark, Omar Navarro. While Idol Net Worth claims that the contents of his bank account and assets are worth around $5 million, most sites claim it's closer to $1.5 million. But that's pretty respectable. Aside from Ozark, Felix is known for his work in Made In Jersey, The Following, and The Good Wife.</p><h2 id=lisa-emery-is-worth-1-9-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lisa Emery Is Worth $1.9 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Net Worth Post claims that Lisa Emery is worth just shy of $2 million.

At the time of this writing, Charlie is set to star in two new movies, one of which stars Christian Bale and Robert Duvall.

But he's also known for his work in Snowpiercer, The Trial Of The Chicago 7, Bordman, House of Cards, Californication, Damages, and As The World Turns.</p><h2 id=julia-garner-is-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Julia Garner Is Worth $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's no doubt that Julia Garner is the biggest breakout star on Ozark.
