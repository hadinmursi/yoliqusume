The reason is not far-fetched. It is a 2 story/unit building and contains more rooms than a bungalow. Building a duplex in Nigeria does not come cheap so it is important to have an idea of the estimated cost so as to prepare ahead. The construction of a duplex can take between 3 to 6 months. How fast it turns out depends largely on factors such as the availability of building materials and commitment of workers.</p><p>However, these factors are greatly influenced by the disbursement of funds. If there is available money to fund every stage of building a duplex, it will be a swift ride. Therefore, having an idea of the cost of building a duplex isn’t a bad idea after all. This article will guide you through on that information.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=types-of-duplex></span> Types of Duplex<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is important to note that there are three types of duplex. They include detached duplex, semi-detached duplex and terrace duplex. These duplex can come out with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 bedrooms. The cost and construction stages differ amongst these different types of duplex.</p><ul><li><strong>Detached duplex:</strong> Detached duplex is a single duplex on a piece of land. It’s a lone duplex on a piece of land.</li><li><strong>Semi-detached duplex:</strong> Semi-detached duplex is a duplex that shares common walls with another duplex within a plot of land.</li><li><strong>Terrace duplex:</strong> Terrace duplex often come in groups of four (4) or more duplexes joined together by common walls.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-it-would-cost-to-build-a-duplex-in-nigeria-today></span> How Much It Would Cost To Build A Duplex in Nigeria Today<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After differentiating the important stages of building a duplex and successfully combining and approximating cost, it is safe to say that one should budget the sum of ₦25 million to ₦30 million to begin the building process from foundation to roofing. It could be cheaper if built in a rural, developing area. Whichever, it is important to be financially prepared and informed so as to finish building on time.</p><p>Estimated prices of different stages of building a duplex will be given in subsequent paragraph below;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cost-of-buying-a-land></span> Cost Of Buying A Land<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Acquiring a plot of land or a plot and half is enough to build a sizable duplex with space. The location of the land determines what price it will go for. A land in a developed, urban area will definitely cost more than one in a developing, rural area. Whichever one chosen, the most important thing is that the land is acquired legally and gives satisfaction to the buyer.&nbsp; A plot of land to build a duplex can go for as low as N400,000 and as high as N20 million. Location determines cost of land.</p><p>There are some legal document notably important while acquiring land in Nigeria.&nbsp; If possible, a lawyer should be involved as a witness and can help in giving the necessary legal advice for acquiring a property.&nbsp; Legally documenting the ownership of an acquired land is more important than anything else.</p><p>These documents include;</p><ul><li>Certificate of ownership</li><li>Deed of conveyance</li><li>Survey plan of land</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=drafting-a-building-plan></span> Drafting A Building Plan<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Constructing a building plan is very important. A plan makes everything go swiftly and orderly. A building plan envelopes every detail about what the house would look like and would be built with. Professional advice should be sought at this stage so that unnecessary mistake can be avoided. The services of architects and building agencies (helps to employ workers) is very necessary at this stage. These services rendered, including payment of workers can cost between N2.5 million and N5 million. This cost is influenced by the style and design of the duplex and its location.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=foundation-construction></span> Foundation Construction<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After a building plan is set up, we move to start building. Setting a strong and well-constructed foundation for the house is the first stage of building. The foundation involves flooring and soak away too. Here, the ground is dug well so as to hold the house firmly.&nbsp; Foundation and flooring can take between 1.5 million to 2 million naira to construct. This cost calculates price of setting out, evacuation, foundation footings, foundation walls and German concrete.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ground-floor-to-lintel-level></span> Ground Floor To Lintel Level<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After the foundation has been laid, the next stage is building the structure of the planned design from the ground floor to lintel level. Here, we have the living room, kitchen, 2 or 3 bedrooms, toilet, bathroom and dining room. Measurement is very important at this stage. This is very necessary for sizes of rooms, doors and windows. In determining the cost of this stage, one must consider the number of blocks, sand, cement and lintel casting. This stage is constructed from the ground floor to the lintel level. Cost of this stage is estimated at N3 million to N5 million.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=first-floor-to-lintel-level></span> First Floor To Lintel Level<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is the stage where the second unit of the house is taken care of. Stairs are constructed to connect the ground floor to the first floor. In carrying out this construction, there is a need for more blocks, sand, cement and lintel casting. Here, 2 or 3 bedrooms are constructed, store room, toilet, bathroom, laundry room and corridors. Cost of this stage ranges from N3 million to N4 million.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=roofing></span> Roofing<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Roofing is the next stage to follow in the construction process. The building materials for roofing includes roof truss, roofing sheets and ceiling (PVC ceiling or Asbestos ceiling). The type of roofing largely determines the cost of roofing. Total cost of roofing a duplex is estimated between N2 million and N3.5 million.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=finishing-stage></span> Finishing Stage<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Finishing is the final stage in building a house. The beauty of a house is in its finishing. It is very important to give the house being built a wonderful finishing with quality building materials. It is advisable to use quality building materials, not just at the stage but in every other stages. Finishing include plastering, floor tiles, painting, wiring, plumbing, windows, doors and gates. Total estimated cost of finishing a duplex is ranged between N3 million and N5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C4yKyraJufqMFuu8Vmma6hnJm2r7OMmmSdraChsrl5yKdkp6GXmr%2BqrY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./david-letterman-speaks-on-regina-lasko-wedding.html>&#171;&nbsp;David Letterman Speaks on Regina Lasko Wedding</a>
