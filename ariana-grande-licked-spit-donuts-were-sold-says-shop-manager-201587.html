Though <strong>Ariana Grande</strong> has <a href=#>publicly apologized</a> for declaring “I hate America” in security camera footage from the Wolfee Donut shop in Lake Elsinore, Calif., the store’s owner, <strong>Joe Marin</strong>, has new allegations against the pop star, 22.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with Us Weekly, Marin revealed that there was more to Grande’s 15-minute visit to his store than initially met the eye. Though Marin was not working at the time of the incident, he reviewed the security camera footage after an employee told him Grande had come in to Wolfee Donuts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“She was being rude,” Marin tells Us. “She kept telling my employee — an experienced donut server — she came to buy six donuts. She kept wanting the donuts in the back because my bakers were baking at that time. So my employee kept going in the back to go get the donuts that they were baking, [then] she brought them out there and put them on top of the donut display, and [Grande] sent her to go get some more.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the clerk was in the back, Grande began to disrupt the un-purchased donuts, Marin claims.&nbsp;</p><p>“She was looking around, and that’s when I saw she was licking two of the donuts,” he says. “Then she went to another tray that was on top and there was a tray of powdered donuts. So I zoomed [the camera into] her mouth, and the powdered ones, she did not lick them, she spit on those. She spit on one of them, and she dared that guy she was seeing and he spit on it, too. I saw they were getting a kick out of it and the two friends she brought, they saw what he did, too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to his 10 security cameras, Marin was able to see the incident from a variety of angles. What made Grande’s actions particularly gross was the fact that the donuts were later served to customers by the unsuspecting servers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I didn’t see who bought them because they were mixed [together],” Marin explained. “Somewhere out there the donuts ended up with a customer because that night we ended up selling out.”</p><p>The initial video, which was posted by <a href=#>TMZ</a>, featured Grande kissing her backup dancer Ricky Alvarez, licking the donuts, and declaring, “What the f—k is that? I hate Americans. I hate America! That’s disgusting,” as a tray of freshly glazed treats was brought out.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Bang Bang” singer released an official apology to Us following the incident, writing: “I am EXTREMELY proud to be an American and I’ve always made it clear that I love my country. What I said in a private moment with my friend, who was buying the donuts, was taken out of context and I am sorry for not using more discretion with my choice of words. As an advocate for healthy eating, food is very important to me and I sometimes get upset by how freely we as Americans eat and consume things without giving any thought to the consequences that it has on our health and society as a whole. The fact that the United States has one of the highest child obesity rates in the world frustrates me. &nbsp;We need to do more to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of overeating and the poison that we put into our bodies. &nbsp;We need to demand more from our food industry. However I should have known better in how I expressed myself; and with my new responsibility to others as a public figure I will strive to be better. As for why I cannot be at the MLB show, I have had emergency oral surgery and due to recovery I cannot attend the show. I hope to make it up to all those fans soon. That being said let me once again apologize if I have offended anyone with my poor choice of words.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5xquYp5yVYrmqr8qem2aroJ7BbrDOp6ytq12ssrOxjKympZxdqK66v4ysn6ioXaKur63GnqlmamBmgnmDjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./big-brother-controversies-through-the-years.html>&#171;&nbsp;Big Brother Controversies Through the Years</a>
