However, there are 'Simpsons' stars with higher net worths, including Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer, Krusty, and various others. The actor has a net worth of $85 million, while Hank Azaria also barely edges him out, with a huge net worth of $90 million. The veteran has voiced countless characters in the past, including Moe, Lou, Professor Frink, and others. He also played on other shows such as 'Friends' and the film 'Godzilla'.</p><p>Believe it or not, <a href=#>these voice-over stars don't come close to the leaders.</a></p><p>Seth MacFarlane has a net worth of $300 million, while Money Inc indicates that South Park stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone are among the top by a mile, with Parker worth $600 million, while Matt Stone is in the vicinity of $700 million.
