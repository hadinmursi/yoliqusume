They said, 'Look, there's so and so.' I said, 'Forget about her. Who is the one on the left? And it was Melania."</p><p>Melania did not give Trump her number. Instead, Melania asked for his, to see what kind of phone number he'd give her.</p><p>"He wanted my number, but he was with a date, so of course I didn't give it to him. I said, 'I am not giving you my number; you give me yours, and I will call you.' I wanted to see what kind of number he would give me—if it was a business number, what is this? I'm not doing business with you."</p><p>Trump gave Melania four different phone numbers, which really showed his interest early on.
