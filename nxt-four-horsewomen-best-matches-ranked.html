They have wrestled in some of the highest-rated matches in WWE and there is a near-guaranteed place in the Hall of Fame waiting for them.

Before this, Bayley proved herself by defeating Carmella, Ember Moon, Nikki Cross, Mandy Rose, Natalya, Naomi and Dana Brooke in the women's Money In The Bank ladder match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The match was fast-paced and told a coherent story, with each Superstar receiving an opportunity to showcase their skills in the spotlight. Bayley cashed in her contract on new champion Charlotte Flair to win her first SmackDown Women's Championship.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-sasha-banks-vs-ronda-rousey-royal-rumble-2019><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Sasha Banks: Sasha Banks vs. Ronda Rousey, Royal Rumble 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ronda-Rousey-Sasha-Banks-Royal-Rumble.jpg><p>Ronda Rousey has faced each of the NXT Four Horsewomen and one of her most entertaining matches was against Sasha Banks at the Royal Rumble in 2019. The Boss had been mostly overlooked since Becky Lynch's rise to the top of the company, though this match reminded fans that she is one of the best wrestlers in the women's division.</p><p>The in-ring psychology for this match was excellent. Banks brought out the best in Rousey and the two shared a believable mixture of dislike and respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becky-lynch-becky-lynch-vs-asuka-royal-rumble-2019><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Becky Lynch: Becky Lynch vs. Asuka, Royal Rumble 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Asuka-Becky-Lynch-Royal-Rumble.jpg><p>The Boss wasn't the only NXT Horsewoman to put on a stellar match at the Royal Rumble. Becky Lynch squared off against Asuka in a losing effort to regain the <a href=#>SmackDown Women's Championship</a>. The two Superstars put on an incredible match with the Empress of Tomorrow retaining her belt, though this didn't stop The Man from later limping to the ring and winning the Royal Rumble match.</p><p>Asuka is one of the most talented wrestlers in the women's division and remains one of Becky Lynch's most formidable enemies. They are set for another Royal Rumble match on January 26th which could see The Man finally beat the Empress after all.</p><h2 id=charlotte-flair-charlotte-flair-vs-trish-stratus-summerslam-2019><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Charlotte Flair: Charlotte Flair vs. Trish Stratus, SummerSlam 2019</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Trish-Stratus-Charlotte-Flair-SummerSlam.jpg><p>Trish Stratus stepped out of retirement and back into the ring for a match against Charlotte Flair at SummerSlam and showed the wrestling world that she's still got it. Trish and Charlotte worked well together and brought the best out of each other as competitors, and hopefully, the two former champions will clash again in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Charlotte Flair Matches (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>Charlotte didn't overshadow Trish's triumphant return but she certainly held her own.

The Boss n Hug Connection defeated Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, Nia Jax and Tamina, The IIconics, Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan and Naomi and Carmella in an intensely physical bout to emerge victorious with championship gold.</p><p>This match is a great example of Bayley and Sasha's in-ring chemistry. They work well together in tandem, particularly when taking down larger opponents such as Tamina and this match was a promising start for the Women's Tag Team titles.</p><h2 id=sasha-banks-sasha-banks-vs-charlotte-flair-vs-becky-lynch-wrestlemania-32><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sasha Banks: Sasha Banks vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch, WrestleMania 32</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sasha-Banks-Becky-Lynch-Charlotte-Flair-WrestleMania-32.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best matches of Sasha Banks' career hails from her earlier days on the main roster. After challenging Charlotte for the Divas Championship, The Boss and The Man took on Flair in a triple-threat match on The Grandest Stage of Them All for the newly introduced WWE Women's Championship.</p><p>Each Superstar had a chance to shine and demonstrate their exceptional abilities. This match felt like a momentous occasion.&nbsp;WWE did away with the butterfly belt and the Divas moniker and this match felt like the true beginning of a revolution.</p><h2 id=becky-lynch-becky-lynch-vs-charlotte-flair-evolution-2019><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Becky Lynch: Becky Lynch vs. Charlotte Flair, Evolution 2019</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Becky-Lynch-Charlotte-Flair-Evolution.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most entertaining feuds of 2019 - and Becky Lynch's career - is The Man's rivalry with her former partner Charlotte Flair. Lynch defeated Flair and went on to defend it against her at the first all-female pay-per-view Evolution in what was easily the best match on the card.</p><p>Lynch and Flair fought in a Last Woman Standing match that pushed the boundaries and elevated women's wrestling. The Man emerged victorious, struggling to her feet after performing a leg drop from the ladder onto her opponent.</p><h2 id=charlotte-flair-charlotte-vs-sasha-banks-raw-2016><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Charlotte Flair: Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks, Raw 2016</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sasha-Banks-3.jpg><p>Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks were at the forefront of the Women's Evolution during 2016.
