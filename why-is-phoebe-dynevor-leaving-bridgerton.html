Sure, <a href=#>Dynevor had some big roles</a> in addition to that of Daphne Bridgerton too, but it seems that her big break led to the same epiphany Page had.

Recently, Phoebe confirmed that she won't appear in the third season of Bridgerton. The abrupt admission on a red carpet wasn't accompanied by a formal statement from Netflix, either. The sudden news left fans to wonder how the show will fare without her—and whether there's anything that could change the future of her character on the show.</p><h2 id=phoebe-dynevor-fought-hard-for-bridgerton>Phoebe Dynevor Fought Hard For Bridgerton</h2><p>From the moment she was cast as Daphne, it seemed that Phoebe Dynevor worked hard at her job.

I've done what I wanted to do with that character and she had a great arc."</p><p>The statement almost sounds as if she knew the role would only last two seasons—or has at least come to terms with it winding down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress elaborated, "If they ask me back in the future, who knows?
