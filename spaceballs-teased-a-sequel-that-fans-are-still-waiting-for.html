usually look to make bank on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sequel film</a>. While this can be lucrative, sometimes, studios drop the ball with sequels, and performers can even be lukewarm on the idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reprising the same role</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the 80s,&nbsp;Spaceballs, which was a brilliant parody of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a>, came into theaters and had a modest reception. The film, however, became a cult classic that has endured for decades. The film’s cult classic status, along with a clever line in the movie, has led to many wondering if a sequel project will ever materialize.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the infamous line that teased a sequel and see if one is in the works.</p><h2 id=spaceballs-is-a-comedy-classic>‘Spaceballs’ Is A Comedy Classic</h2><p>During the 80s, a parody movie called Spaceballs rolled into theaters, and while it was not a major financial success at the time, it developed into a cult classic after it’s video release and subsequently became one of the most famous comedies of its era. The film was a brilliant balance of parody and storytelling, and it did an impeccable job of poking some fun at Star Wars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring excellent performers like Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Rick Moranis,&nbsp;Spaceballs has forged a unique legacy in the film industry thanks to Mel Brooks’ brand of humor. Prior to Spaceballs, Brooks had done movies like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which should give a pretty good indication about the type of humor that we are talking about. Turns out, his hilarious take on&nbsp;Star Wars was a stroke of genius that has remained popular for several decades.</p><p>Some of the movies that Brooks made preceding Spaceballs were far more popular at the time, but as the years have gone on, Spaceballs has become one of his most popular flicks. This was on the heels of an initial lukewarm reception and modest take home at the box office. The film is proof that quality can endure&nbsp;and that word-of-mouth has a ton of power in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film has no shortage of hilarious moments and memorable lines, and one of the funniest parts of the movie actually touched on a sequel being made in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Doctor Strange 2’ Screenwriter Michael Waldron Says The Sequel Will Be ‘Unlike Anything Seen Before’ In MCU</a></span></p><h2 id=a-sequel-was-teased-in-the-original>A Sequel Was Teased In The Original</h2><p>During one scene in the movie, Brooks’ character, Yogurt, who was a parody of Yoda, gives a little insight about the future of the franchise.</p><p>Bill Pullman’s Lone Star asks Yogurt if the duo will ever see each other again, to which Yogurt says, “Who knows? God willing, we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, this quote was humorous and seems relatively innocent enough, but over the years, the fans have grown increasingly more curious about a sequel film&nbsp;being made. After all, the first Spaceballs wound up being a cult classic, and movie studios want nothing more than to be able to cash in from an already-established property. So far, however, we have yet to see a sequel be put into production.</p><p>It has now been 34 years since&nbsp;Spaceballs first hit theaters, and to be honest, a sequel ever being made seems increasingly more unlikely.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dana White Wanted To Pay David Spade To Make This Sequel</a></span></p><h2 id=a-sequel-seems-unlikely>A Sequel Seems Unlikely</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Rick Moranis</a>, who played Dark Helmet, “Mel wanted to do a sequel after it became a cult video hit. It wasn’t a box office hit. It was a cult video hit, and MGM wanted to do a sequel. And my idea for it was <i>Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II</i>.”</p><p>“I wasn’t privy to what the budget was or anything, but the deal he presented me, what he wanted me to do, was not workable... because it is so specific, it’s counter-productive to talk about it. But I was unable to make a deal, and it would have been something I would have wanted to do. But that ship has sailed,” Moranis explained.</p><p>It’s a shame that nothing has materialized at this point, especially considering that people who took part in the original are still on board with making a sequel. Moranis took a lengthy break from acting, though he has a made a return in recent years, even reprising Dark Helmet in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Goldbergs</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will There Be A 'Cruella 2'? 10 Things We've Learned About The Planned Sequel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of a poorly-received animated series,&nbsp;Spaceballs projects have been on the shelf since the 80s. The franchise likely won’t return to the big screen, which means we just have to dust off our DVD and enjoy the lovable classic once more.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will We Ever See A 'School Of Rock' Sequel?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqZmTmq%2BiuMusZK2dkaiypXnAZqqeqaWauW7Ax5qrZp6Ro8BurdGeZKysmaG5bsPAoquippdis7C%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./17-best-softest-sherpa-sweaters-tops-fall-winter-fashion-amazon.html>&#171;&nbsp;17 Best and Softest Sherpa Tops for Fall Under $35</a>
