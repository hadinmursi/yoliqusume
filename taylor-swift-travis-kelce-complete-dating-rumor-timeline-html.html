Taylor Swift has a new man dating rumor in her life. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce set his sights on Taylor Swift during the U.S. leg of her Eras Tour, delighting everyone who likes to make sports puns and/or Swift lyrics references in daily conversation. Kelce made the first attempt at contacting Swift, reaching out at her tour’s KC stop and trying to give her his number. “She doesn’t meet anybody — or at least she didn’t want to meet me,” Kelce told his brother Jason on their&nbsp;<a href=#>New Heights&nbsp;podcast</a>. “So, I took it personal.” He also told Jason he’d tried to pass her a friendship bracelet, but couldn’t make the completion: “I was a little butthurt that I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.” Eventually the two got together when she attended one of his games (at her football stadium).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmy7g7vo00103b7h7086nwmd@published data-word-count=72>At least that’s what we thought the timeline was!

Like any sane person, Kelce objects to the interviewer keeping “kill” in there when “fuck” has been replaced with “kiss.” That says something very ugly about society, no? Kelce says he’d kill Grande, “kiss” Tayla, and marry Katy Perry. Mind you, this is when Perry and Swift were still beefing. Not until the “You Need to Calm Down” video, where Perry was the hamburger to Swift’s fries, did the two publicly end their feud. But it’s possible Kelce was too immersed in the ball-is-lifestyle to know about pop-star feuds.
