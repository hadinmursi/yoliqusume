His mother was involved in the drug trade, while his father battled addiction and alcohol abuse. The artist also has an older sister and twin brothers, making for a complex family dynamic.</p><p>Tragically, Avalon’s father’s struggle with alcoholism ultimately led to a fatal accident.

His own struggles with drug addiction and involvement in prostitution were instrumental in his pursuit of a career in music. After moving to Portland, Oregon, he and his sister supported each other in their recovery journeys.

It was during this time that he crossed paths with musician Simon Rex, who became a pivotal figure in his musical journey. Avalon not only found solace in music but also extended his support to his brothers, introducing them to the industry.</p><p>As of now, Mickey Avalon owns two apartments, one in Camarillo and another in Sunnyvale, California, showcasing his success and newfound stability.
