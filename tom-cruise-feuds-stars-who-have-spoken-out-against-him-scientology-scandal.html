On top of jumping on Oprah Winfrey's couch, Cruise also once smugly criticized people for taking antidepressants during this era, according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While talking to Matt Lauer about antidepressants in 2005, Cruise called Brooke Shields "irresponsible" for taking them to help cope with postpartum depression. Going further than that even, Cruise also judged Shields' career while implying that taking antidepressants may have played a role in her lack of success at that time.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Shields was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about Cruise's comments at the time and she was very blunt</a>. “Tom should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them."</p><p>Shields later revealed that <a href=#>Cruise had apologized to her</a> when she was being interviewed by Jay Leno. "[Cruise] came over to my house and he gave me a heartfelt apology.

According to TMZ's report, when Cruise sat for a deposition, he appeared to compare the work he'd done in the Middle East for a movie to soldiers serving in Afghanistan.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the idea that Cruise compared his movie star treatment to soldiers fighting outraged many.</p><p>In Cruise's defense, TMZ's report appears to have been misleading. As Cruise's lawyer revealed, the actor was asked if he actually thought working on a movie and being a soldier were the same thing during the deposition. In response, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise clarified he didn't mean that by saying "Oh, come on"</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Author Complained About Having Tom Cruise In Her Film Adaptation, But Later Realized She Was Very Wrong</a></span></p><p>Before it was revealed that Cruise clearly didn't mean that, Mark Wahlberg was asked about the training he did for the movie Lone Survivor. In response, Wahlberg went off on actors who would compare what they do to what soldiers go through. While Wahlberg didn't mention Cruise by name, it was incredibly obvious that he was responding to the Mission: Impossible actor's perceived comments.</p><p>"For somebody to sit there and say 'my job was as difficult as being in the military.'

Since then, Remini has seemingly made it her mission in life to publicly speak out against Scientology and give others who've left the religion the chance to do the same.</p><p>If Remini wanted, she could have spoken out about Scientology without mentioning the religion's most famous advocate. Instead, Remini has opted to speak about Tom Cruise very harshly. A perfect example of that is when Remini took part in a 2017 Reddit AMA <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where she unleashed on Cruise</a> after being asked if he is a "good person".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No!

Years before that in 2009, Baldwin was speaking at Elle magazine's annual Women in Hollywood dinner and awards show when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he called Cruise out by name</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his speech, Baldwin pretty much said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise's greed plays a role in Hollywood's gender pay inequality</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jamie Foxx Lost Out On An Oscar-Winning Role In Jerry Maguire Because He Couldn't Resist Trying To Impress Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>"I believe we can balance the scales if Tom Cruise would lower his quote by a mere $29 million.

After all, Presley wasn't an actor, so it seems like the two celebrities would have no reason to interact enough for her to have a strong opinion about Cruise.</p><p>As it turns out, however, the reason that Presley spoke out about Cruise is related to Scientology. A former member of the religion, Presley joined after her famous mother did.</p><p>Before Presley tragically passed away, she was interviewed by Scientology critic Tony Ortega. During that interview, Presley claimed that the religion's leader David Miscavige took interest in her once she turned 25 years old and inherited her father's fortune.</p><p>“At 25, after I got the inheritance, they started grooming me to be this person who would go out and get everyone else in.” Presley walked about from Scientology but not before meeting Cruise, and she told Ortega that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she couldn't stand the famous actor</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I f–king hate Tom[Cruise].

On top of that, Apatow doesn't make the kind of movies that Cruise typically gets involved with, so it doesn't seem like he should have any reason to resent the actor.</p><p>In the past, Seth Rogen revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise once tried to speak to him and Apatow about joining Scientology</a>. Still, that doesn't seem like enough to inspire <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apatow's incredibly harsh comments about Cruise</a> during a monologue he gave at a 2023 Directors Guild of America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Cruise Came Across As A Completely Different Person During His First Ever Appearance With David Letterman</a></span></p><p>First off, Apatow mocked Cruise's height. “The special effects in ‘Maverick’ were so top notch, I couldn’t even see the stack of phone books Tom Cruise sat on to reach the flight controls.” Apatow then went off on Cruise's jumping on Oprah Winfrey's couch. “Remember when Tom Cruise jumped up and down on the couch and we all thought, 'What a lunatic!'"</p><p>Apatow then discussed Cruise's obsession with doing his own stunts, stating that is an indication something is wrong with the actor. "Tom is not fine!" Worst of all, Apatow called out Cruise's parenting and comments about antidepressants. “The only thing he seems to be afraid of is co-parenting and antidepressants,"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-mickey-rourke-speak-out-against-tom-cruise><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Why Did Mickey Rourke Speak Out Against Tom Cruise?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/What-Happened-Between-Tom-Cruise-And-Mickey-Rourke.jpg><p>At the end of the day, Tom Cruise is defined in the public eye as an actor and movie star. However, based on what Mickey Rourke had to say about Cruise when he was interviewed by Piers Morgan in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has no respect for the Mission: Impossible star as an actor</a>. After Morgan spoke about Cruise starring in 2022's most successful movie, Rourke didn't hold back.</p><p>“That doesn’t mean s--t to me. [Tom Cruise has] been doing the same part for 35 effing years. I got no respect for that. I don’t care about money or power. I care about…when I when I watch Al Pacino or Christopher Walken working, or De Niro’s early work and Richard Harris and Ray Winstone, that’s the kind of actor I want to be like. A lot of guys that tried to stretch as actors.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later in the same interview, Morgan bluntly asked Rourke if Cruise is a "good actor". Since Cruise's performances in the past have received a lot of praise, it may seem like Rourke would give him that, but he simply responded, “I think he’s irrelevant".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZJ%2BdpZnAbr%2FTmqmsZaedvG60wK%2BcZqugpLimuoyorK1lkZyuqrrSrWShoZ1iwKS1xKerqKSfnMZuv8KapZ2ZnGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./trey-gowdy-wife-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;Trey Gowdy Wife Photos: Terri Dillards Role &amp;amp; Influence</a>
