That has not only been satisfying for me personally and creatively, but it has launched me creatively into a whole other world. I have a creative life now, because of the Halloween movie, and the success,” she admitted.</p><h2 id=jamie-lee-curtis-was-reluctant-to-work-with-jake-gyllenhaal-in-letters-from-camp>Jamie Lee Curtis Was Reluctant To Work With Jake Gyllenhaal In Letters From Camp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jamie-lee-curtis-and-jake-gyllenhaal-at-the-convenant-premiere.jpeg><p>Despite their closeness, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jake Gyllenhaal have never starred in a movie together. But they did work together on the actress’ podcast series Letter from Camp, although <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Curtis was initially reluctant to ask her godson to collaborate with her on this project</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was nervous about asking Jake,” Curtis admitted to Newsweek. “Because I don’t want [our relationship] to be transactional.” This is also why she’s reluctant to star in any movies alongside her godson. “I don’t ask him to come to movie premieres. I don’t ask when people do long lead interviews in magazines, and they always say, ‘Well, can we call Jake? Can we call Arnold Schwarzenegger to get quotes?’ I say ‘no, you can’t call Jake,’” she said.</p><p>The only reason why Gyllenhaal did voice-over work for Letter From Camp was simply by coincidence. “During COVID, he arrived in Los Angeles and needed a place to stay so he moved in to this house next door I have. He ended up staying there for four or five months,” Curtis recalled. “He came over one day, and I had this kind of look on my face. And he was like, ‘What’s going on with you?’ I was like, ‘Is there any way you would consider voicing this?’ Within a second, he was like, ‘Yes, of course. Oh, my God. Oh, how fun. Who is he? What do I get to do? What’s he do?’ And he immediately turned him into a character.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn66utcRmo56dXZjCs8DIrGSwmaNiv6a41JyrmqakYsGwedaoqaRlp57BqXnJmqKeZZeuua2xzaGYmqRf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./theater-review-natasha-pierre-on-broadway-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Theater Review: Silly Tolstoy?
