He has already split (albeit amicably) with his former buddy Trick Williams, and he would be a great fit in whatever faction Bobby Lashley is assembling over on SmackDown.

Once Melo became the NXT Champion, everyone expected a heel turn, and they did get one - but it was not from Trick, but rather Bron Breakker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Six months in, the former wide receiver has finally validated himself as a singles wrestler, taking Ilja Dragunov to the limit and capturing the NXT North American Championship also at No Mercy - even if the ensuing reign lasted <a href=#>just three days</a>.

Well, it is because other than being the standard Scottish brawlers, not much about their presentation stands out.</p><p>Leader Joe Coffey is the foremost example of this. While he hits hard and has a very mean mug, he does not have that much charisma. Sure, he and his allies Mark Coffey and Wofgang may be able to prop him up as a brutish ruler whose enforcers strike an imposing figure, bur the point still stands: where is their charm?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-be-noam-dar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Should Be: Noam Dar</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Noam-Dar.jpg><p>Noam Dar is the exact opposite of Joe Coffey: not exactly the most physically imposing wrestler in the world, but one who has two things going for him: 1) unprecedented technical wrestling skill (as evidenced by his stranglehold on the Heritage Cup since its inception) and 2) an uncanny ability to generate heel heat.</p><p>Just look at him: He screams "jerk who should be hated by all, yet somehow has an equally insufferable entourage".

His career is filled with bad creative direction after bad creative direction, and while it is said that most wrestlers peak in their 30s, he may already be past it - at least creatively. His safe in-ring style may also not cut it with NXT's penchant for outrageous spots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-be-dijak><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Should Be: Dijak</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dijak-entrance-cropped.jpg><p>Remember when Dominik Dijakovic was considered one of the most promising WWE prospects alongside Keith Lee? Then RETRIBUTION happened, and he lost almost all his stock as that stable ate loss after loss - then he became a jobber, both in singles and tags.</p><p>So he went back to NXT - but not as his old self. Rather, it was as the imposing "bringer of justice" Dijak, and it is a great gimmick. The man is on a mission to achieve justice - and winning the NXT Championship is a great way to do that and redeem himself for his horrible past booking. Just ask Mandy Rose.</p><h2 id=should-not-be-joe-gacy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Should Not Be: Joe Gacy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joe-gacy-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Schism once aspired to be the next Wyatt Family - a devilish cult leader in Joe Gacy and a group of loyal followers in Ava Raine and the Grizzled Young Veterans, who would be renamed The Dyad.

Now Gacy has just Ava beside him, and she could break out on her own soon.

Why? Rey can still deliver in the ring, as evidenced by his current United States title run and angle with the LWO; and Lee needs to work on the intangibles before being considered for a call-up. Holding the NXT title would be a good indicator.</p><h2 id=should-not-be-bron-breakker><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Should Not Be: Bron Breakker</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collage-maker-30-may-2023-03-30-pm-8458.jpg><p>Look, everyone loves Bron Breakker.
